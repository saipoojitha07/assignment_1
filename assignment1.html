    <h2>Why We Need a Server to Show Websites on the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        We need server because it stores all the website's data and information in it 
        and give access whenever user needs it like example if  we a enter a website 
        name or it's address the server sends the required website on to our browser Page 
        and can be used by multiple users at the same time so without the server there
        will no website files will be stored hence we can't access websites on the internet
